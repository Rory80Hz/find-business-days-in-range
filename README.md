## Install

```sh
npm i -S find-business-days-in-range
```


## Usage

```js
var findBusinessDaysInRange = require('find-business-days-in-range').calc

findBusinessDaysInRange(new Date(2015, 1, 1), new Date(2015, 1, 5), 'America/Los_Angeles')
// 3
```

## Methods
### calc `(<Date> start, <Date> end[, <String> timezone])`
Pass in a start and end date, and get back the count of business days in between. Optionally, you can pass in a timezone in Olson TZID format (e.g. `America/Los_Angeles`) to coerce the dates to that timezone. Otherwise, the calculation is done using the system time.

## Tests
Tests are [prova](https://github.com/azer/prova), based on [tape](https://github.com/substack/tape). They can be run with `npm test`.

Tests can be run in a loop with `npm run tdd`

## Developing
To publish, run `npm run release -- [{patch,minor,major}]`

_NOTE: you might need to `sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/node /usr/bin/node` to ensure node is in your path for the git hooks to work_

### Requirements
* **npm > 2.0.0** So that passing args to a npm script will work. `npm i -g npm`
* **git > 1.8.3** So that `git push --follow-tags` will work. `brew install git`
